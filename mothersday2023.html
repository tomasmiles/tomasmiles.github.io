		<h1>Happy Mother's Day</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>To Mum</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Once I was a little shoot, barely there,</p>
		<p>Hiding.</p>
		<p>You shared your food, I grew, I kicked.</p>
		<p>Eventually ejected into the world outside you.</p>
		<p>Once I could not hold my own head high.</p>
		<p>Screaming wordlessly. Guess my needs!</p>
		<p>Who knew there was a time and place to potty?</p>
		<p>For the longest time, not I.</p>
		<p>The years under the same roof, still I am fed.</p>
		<p>The old challenges surpassed, new challenges arise.</p>
		<p>Eager to grow, I did not know</p>
		<p>How lucky I was to have all I did.</p>
		<p>You taught me what it means to be a good parent.</p>
		<p>If I'm lucky I'll be half as good as you.</p>
		<p>Thank you Mum.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Lots of love,</p>
		<p>Tomas</p>
